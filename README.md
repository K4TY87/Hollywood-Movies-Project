# Hollywood-Movies-Project
This was a very enjoyable project to work on, using R studio and Power BI. It was based on Hollywood movies data between 2007-2011. I am very proud to present this to you. To see the full extent of my findings, please download my handbook. Here is my completed dashboard. Have a lovely day :)
